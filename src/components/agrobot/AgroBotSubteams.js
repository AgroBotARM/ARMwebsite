Last year, (our very first year) we developed a simple, square, modular chassis that would allow us to house all the components of the robot and allow us to be flexible in our future developments. The robot utilizes four, independently driven wheels, with swerve steering front wheels. This design aims to allow for easier maneuverability in a crop field, allows the robot to go over crop rows, and make tight turns at the end of each row.';

We developed a working prototype of the herbicide sprayer, complete with targeting software, and continue to work on the weedwhacker. In the upcoming year we will work on finishing the weedwhacker while improving and finalizing the herbicide sprayer. This will include continued mechanical design, robotics, small electronics, programming, and pumping systems. We will also be looking at possible new ways of attacking weeds.'; // BEGIN: ed8c6549bwf9

In our first year, our team explored methods of crop-row detection and developed software to facilitate real-time motion planning. We have worked together to research different methods of computer vision and error control algorithms and applied these concepts to Python code using OpenCV. The software loads live-stream video, employs a series of filtering and transformations to detect crop-rows, and then applies a centering algorithm to determine the direction of the AgroBot. In our upcoming year, our team plans to improve the accuracy of our navigation software while also integrating the software with the motor control system. This entails incorporating additional computer vision techniques to our code, implementing a robust software controller for continuous error adjustment and incorporating ROS for communication between subsystems.';

Using computer vision and machine learning algorithms, the team has developed models for weed destruction that detect and classify weeds, enabling targeted extermination and reducing the use of herbicides. In addition, the team focuses on developing models for biomass estimation. These models help farmers to accurately determine the amount of biomass that their crops are producing, which is a crucial factor in making informed decisions about fertilizer and water application. With this knowledge, farmers can achieve better crop yields and save on costs, all while minimizing their environmental impact.';
